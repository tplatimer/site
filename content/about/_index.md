## Work Experience

#### Modea: Analytics Team Manager

June 2020-Present I run a team of Web Analysts and Data Scientist (we all wear multiple hats) that work with our digital consultancy, focusing on healthcare and nonprofit clients. While I remain executional on client work, I'm also in charge of helping standardize and optimize our toolkit and our processes. We've developed an ever-growing code base of commonly used scripts, functions and stylings. We've transformed our ad-hoc collection of one-off analyses into a library of common, automated reports. We've also instituted bitbucket as a system of code storage and version control. I also, most importantly, played a role in hiring excellent analysts who are much smarter than me, and who are able to take my ideas and carry them much further and better than I could dream of.

#### Modea: Senior Analyst \| Analyst \| Associate Analyst

April 2017-June 2020 Before I was in charge, I was a brand-new analyst at a small company. We've grown a lot since then. Most of our work was in Google Analytics, where we started with basic reporting to support our internal design team and to supplement client needs. We expanded to automated reporting, dashboard creation, tag management and implementation, and worked with a range of nonprofits to help them market more efficiently and better target their donors. As part of that work, we expanded our data science practice and never looked back.

#### Roanoke Times: Web Editor

May 2016-April 2017 I managed online content posting and social media posting for a regional (60k circulation) newspaper. Provided video content creation for special coverage events. Produced video, print and audio content. $$Some people thought my web design was innovative$$([https://roanoke.com/news/inland-press-association-awards-roanoke-times-for-online-project-on-virginia-tech-shootings/article\_d9274689-2119-506d-8cea-229baecf56a6.html).](https://roanoke.com/news/inland-press-association-awards-roanoke-times-for-online-project-on-virginia-tech-shootings/article_d9274689-2119-506d-8cea-229baecf56a6.html).){.uri}

#### Greensboro News & Record: Staff Writer

September 2013-May 2016 If you read this far, congrats! You know I used to be a sports reporter. I covered the ACC in North Carolina (Tobacco Road, if you know, you know). Again, if you've read this far, I'm assuming you're not turned off by my writing --- this stuff is where I learned how to communicate, and also why deadlines don't scare me.
