First, be very, very stressed and anxious about the world amid a global pandemic.
Then, decide you have to do something or you'll go insane just scrolling twitter all day.
Next, look at the [hugo themes list page](https://themes.gohugo.io/) and think oooohhhh that one looks good.
Next, read through the wonderful blogdown book on [building websites with Rstudio](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
Think: "wait can I do this? I think I can"
blogdown::serve_site() works once and you get extremely excited.
Realize you have made a huge mistake. Start over. Figure out those pesky header images. [Actually read the documentation for the theme config.](https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect)
Decide you're a digital analyst and dammit, if you're going to do this, you should have GTM installed. [Find a very helpful guide](https://martijnvanvreeden.nl/how-to-add-google-tag-manager-to-hugo-static-website/).
Commit and push!
Realize you have made a typo. Fix it.
Commit and push again!
Repeat ad infinitum.
